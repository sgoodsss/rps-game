# <Rock, Paper, Scissors Game>

## Description

This project was a tool I used to help me understand JavaScript.  I followed along using a tutorial to achieve the main functionality of the game, then I tweaked things to my liking.

My motivation for completing this Rock, Paper, Scissors Game is to help me practice JavaScript and become more comfortable using it.  JavaScript has been challenging for me so far, but building this game and having someone walk me through each step was so helpful!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use Rock, Paper, Scissors Game, select one of the three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  The computer will also choose a randomized option.  The scoreboard at the top of the page keeps track of the score.  Underneath the scoreboard, the webpage will tell you if the game was a win, tie or loss.
